## RubyGA

RubyGA is a Genetic Algorithm framework implemented as part of a series of exercises in the course _IT3708 Subsymbolic Methods in AI_ at [NTNU](http://ntnu.no).

See [exercise 1](RubyGA/blob/master/docs/assignment-1.pdf?raw=true) on how we programmed the basics of the evolutionary algorithm, and implemented a solution to the [Colonel Blotto problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Blotto) using it.
In [exercise 2](RubyGA/blob/master/docs/assignment-1.pdf?raw=true) we applied the framework to solve the Traveling Saleman Problem.

*Note: The framework should be considered far from perfect/finished, but solved the intended tasks and could provide a foundation for solving other problems as well.*
